      Tashkent (/tæʃˈkɛnt/, Uzbek: Toshkent, Тошкент/تاشکند, US also /tɑːʃ-/)
      (from Russian: Ташкент), or Toshkent (/tɒʃˈkɛnt/; IPA: [tɒʃˈkent]),
      also historically known as Chach is the capital and largest city of
      Uzbekistan, as well as the most populous city in Central Asia, with a
      population of about 3 million.[1] It is in northeastern Uzbekistan, near
      the border with Kazakhstan. Tashkent comes from the Turkic tash and kent,
      literally translated as "Stone City" or "City of Stones".
Before Islamic influence started in the mid-8th century AD, Tashkent was
influenced by the Sogdian and Turkic cultures. After Genghis Khan destroyed it
in 1219, it was rebuilt and profited from the Silk Road. From the 18th to the
19th century, the city became an independent city-state, before being
re-conquered by the Khanate of Kokand. In 1865, Tashkent fell to the Russian
Empire; it became the capital of Russian Turkestan. In Soviet times, it
witnessed major growth and demographic changes due to forced deportations
from throughout the Soviet Union. Much of Tashkent was destroyed in the 1966
Tashkent earthquake, but it was rebuilt as a model Soviet city. It was the
fourth-largest city in the Soviet Union at the time, after Moscow, Leningrad
and Kyiv.
Today, as the capital of an independent Uzbekistan, Tashkent retains a
multiethnic population, with ethnic Uzbeks as the majority. In 2009, it
celebrated its 2,200 years of written history.

  Samarkand (/ˈsæmərkænd/; Uzbek: Самарқанд, Samarqand, pronounced [samarqand, –qant];),
  also known as Samarqand, is a city in southeastern Uzbekistan and among the oldest
  continuously inhabited cities in Central Asia. There is evidence of human activity
  in the area of the city from the late Paleolithic Era. Though there is no direct
  evidence of when Samarkand was founded, several theories propose that it was founded
  between the 8th and 7th centuries BCE. Prospering from its location on the Silk Road
  between China and Europe, at times Samarkand was one of the largest[2] cities of
  Central Asia.[3] Most of the inhabitants of this city are native Persian-speakers
  and speak the Tajik Persian dialect. This city is one of the historical centers of
   the Tajik people in Central Asia, which in the past was one of the important cities
   of the great empires of Iran. By the time of the Achaemenid Empire of Persia,
   it was the capital of the Sogdian satrapy. The city was conquered by Alexander
   the Great in 329 BCE, when it was known as Markanda, which was rendered in
   Greek as Μαράκανδα.[6] The city was ruled by a succession of Iranian and
   Turkic rulers until it was conquered by the Mongols under Genghis Khan in 1220.
   Today, Samarkand is the capital of Samarqand Region and a district-level city,
   that includes the urban-type settlements Kimyogarlar, Farxod and Xishrav.
   With 551,700 inhabitants (2021), it is the second-largest city of Uzbekistan.
  The city is noted as a centre of Islamic scholarly study and the birthplace of
  the Timurid Renaissance. In the 14th century, Timur (Tamerlane) made it the
  capital of his empire and the site of his mausoleum, the Gur-e Amir.
  The Bibi-Khanym Mosque, rebuilt during the Soviet era, remains one of the
  city's most notable landmarks. Samarkand's Registan square was the city's
  ancient centre and is bounded by three monumental religious buildings.

  Khiva (Uzbek: Xiva/Хива, خىۋا; Persian: خیوه, Xīveh; alternative or historical names include Kheeva, Khorasam, Khoresm, Khwarezm, Khwarizm, Khwarazm, Chorezm, Arabic: خوارزم and Persian: خوارزم) is a district-level city of approximately 93,000 people in Xorazm Region, Uzbekistan.[2] According to archaeological data, the city was established around 1500 years ago.[3] It is the former capital of Khwarezmia, the Khanate of Khiva, and the Khorezm People's Soviet Republic. Itchan Kala in Khiva was the first site in Uzbekistan to be inscribed in the World Heritage List (1991). The astronomer, historian and polymath, Al-Biruni[4] (973-1048 CE) was born in either Khiva or the nearby city of Kath.
  The origin of the name Khiva is unknown, but many contradictory stories have been told to explain it.

  A traditional story attributes the name to one of the sons of the prophet Noah: "It is said that Shem, after the flood, he found himself wandering in the desert alone. Having fallen asleep, he dreamt of 300 burning torches. On waking up, he was pleased with this omen, he founded the city with outlines in the form of a ship mapped out according to the placement of the torches, about which he had dreamt. Then Shem dug the Kheyvak well, the water from which had a surprising taste. It is possible to see this well in Ichan-Kala (an internal town of Khiva City) even today."[5]

  Another proposal is that the name comes from the word Khwarezm, altered by borrowing into Turkic as Khivarezem, then shortened to Khiva.

  Another possibility is that it came from the Śiva tribe of the Battle of the Ten Kings.

  Bukhara (Uzbek: Buxoro/Бухоро, pronounced [buχɒrɒ]; Tajik: Бухоро, pronounced [buxɔːˈɾɔː]) is the seventh-largest city in Uzbekistan, with a population of 280,187 as of 1 January 2020,[1] and the capital of Bukhara Region.[2]
  People have inhabited the region around Bukhara for at least five millennia, and the city has existed for half that time. Located on the Silk Road, the city has long served as a center of trade, scholarship, culture, and religion. The mother tongue of the majority of people of Bukhara is Tajik, a dialect of the Persian language,[3] although Uzbek is spoken as a second language by most residents. Bukhara served as the capital of the Samanid Empire, Khanate of Bukhara, and Emirate of Bukhara and was the birthplace of scholar Imam Bukhari.[4] The city has been known as "Noble Bukhara" (Bukhārā-ye sharīf). Bukhara has about 140 architectural monuments. UNESCO has listed the historic center of Bukhara (which contains numerous mosques and madrasas) as a World Heritage Site.
According to some scholars, the name dates back to the Sanskrit "Vihara" (Buddhist monastery).[7][8][9] This word is very close to the word in the language of the Uyghur and Chinese Buddhists, who named their places of worship the same way. Very few artifacts related to Buddhism have survived to modern age in the city. But, numerous Arabic, Persian, European and Chinese travellers and historians noted the place and Uzbekistan itself to be once populated by mostly Buddhists and few Zoroastrians. Indeed the first Islamic text on Bukhara relates to the first Arab invader of Bukhara, Ubaidullah bin Ziad, who noted Bukhara to be a Buddhist country with Buddhist monasteries ruled by a queen regent acting on behalf of her son.
